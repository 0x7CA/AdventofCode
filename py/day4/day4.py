""" Advent of Code Day 4
Part 1:
Manage N Bingo Boards and mark drawn values on them until a sheet has bingo, then calculate sum of unmarked values
Part 2:
Same as part 1, but continue game until the last bingo board has won, and calculate score of that last winner

Special considerations: 
    Lookup table is used to find the corresponding grid position to a value quickly
    Bingo is checked by keeping a marked-values tally per row and column
    Sum of unmarked values is retrieved by using marked values as a boolean mask
    Last winner is retrieved by eliminating winning boards from the drawing game
